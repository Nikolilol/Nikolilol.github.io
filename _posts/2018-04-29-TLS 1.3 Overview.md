# TLS 1.3 Overview

## Handshake Mechanism

### TLS 1.2 ECDHE （基于 ECDHE 加密算法的 TLS 1.2）

To understand why TLS 1.3 is awesome, we need to take a step back and look at how TLS 1.2 works. In particular we will look at modern TLS 1.2, the kind that a recent browser would use when connecting to the CloudFlare edge.<br>
想要了解 TLS 1.3 的卓越之处，首先需要了解之前的 TLS 1.2 是如何工作的。在这里我们主要关注最新的 TLS 1.2，既当前浏览器访问 CloudFlare 端所使用的版本。

![TLS-1.3.004](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.004.png){:width="100%"}

The client starts by sending a message called the ClientHello that essentially says "hey, I want to speak TLS 1.2, with one of these cipher suites".<br>
首先，由客户端发送一条 ‘ClientHello’ 的信息，表示 “hey，我想使用 TLS 1.2 以及密文族中的一种加密方式来与你通信”。

The server receives that and answers with a ServerHello that says "sure, let's speak TLS 1.2, and I pick this cipher suite".<br>
服务端收到后回复 ‘ServerHello’ 表示 “好的，那就使用 TLS 1.2 和你要用的加密方式”。

Along with that the server sends its key share. The specifics of this key share change based on what cipher suite was selected. When using ECDHE, key shares are mixed with the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman algorithm.<br>
同时服务端发送自己的 key share （共享密钥），共享密钥为何决定于之前客户端选择的加密方式。当使用 ECDHE 加密时，共享密钥为 Elliptic Curve 与 Diffie Hellman 的混合算法。

The important part to understand is that for the client and server to agree on a cryptographic key, they need to receive each other's portion, or share.<br>
这里需要重点注意的是，为了使客户端和服务端就加密密钥达成一致，他们需要共享或接收彼此的一部分（随机码，来验证加密方式）。

Finally, the server sends the website certificate (signed by the CA) and a signature on portions of ClientHello and ServerHello, including the key share, so that the client knows that those are authentic.<br>
最后，服务端发送网站的证书（由CA签署）和‘ClientHello’‘ServerHello’部分的签名，包括共享密钥，以便客户端验证服务端的真实性。

The client receives all that, and then generates its own key share, mixes it with the server key share, and thus generates the encryption keys for the session.<br>
客户端收到所有消息，然后生成自己的共享密钥，将其与服务端的共享密钥混合，从而生成会话的加密密钥。

Finally, the client sends the server its key share, enables encryption and sends a Finished message (which is a hash of a transcript of what happened so far). The server does the same: it mixes the key shares to get the key and sends its own Finished message.<br>
最后，客户端向服务端发送共享密钥（就是之前记录的副本的 hash），启动加密并发送完成消息。服务端也这么做，混合共享密钥启动加密，并发送完成消息。

At that point we are done, and we can finally send useful data encrypted on the connection.<br>
这是握手机制完毕，最终我们可以在加密的连接上进行数据交互。

Notice that this takes two round-trips between the client and the server before the HTTP request can be transferred. And round-trips on the Internet can be slow.<br>
这里要注意，在进行 HTTP 请求之前，客户端与服务端需要交互 2 次。每多一次交互，响应的时间也会相应的增加。

### TLS 1.3

Enter TLS 1.3. While TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 are not that different, 1.3 is a big jump.<br>
Most importantly, establishing a TLS 1.3 connection takes one less round-trip.<br>
让我们回到 TLS 1.3，虽然 TLS 1.0，1.1 和 1.2 并没有那么不同，但 1.3 有很大的改变。最重要的改变是，建立一个 TLS 1.3 链接少一次握手。

![TLS-1.3.007](https://github.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/raw/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.007.png){:width="100%"}

In TLS 1.3 a client starts by sending not only the ClientHello and the list of supported ciphers, but it also makes a guess as to which key agreement algorithm the server will choose, and sends a key share for that.<br>
在 TLS 1.3 中，客户端不仅发送 ClientHello 和支持的加密方法列表，还会对服务端将使用哪种密钥协商算法做一个猜测，并发送其猜测的共享密钥。

(Note: the video calls the key agreement algorithm "cipher suite". In the meantime the specification has been changed to disjoin supported cipher suites like AES-GCM-SHA256 and supported key agreements like ECDHE P-256.)<br>
（注意：视频中将密钥协商算法称为"密码套件"。现在，该规范已更改为支持加密套件如 AES-GCM-SHA256 和支持密钥协议如 "ECDHE P-256"。）

And that saves us a round trip, because as soon as the server selects the cipher suite and key agreement algorithm, it's ready to generate the key, as it already has the client key share. So it can switch to encrypted packets one whole round-trip in advance.<br>
这样就少用了一次握手，因为当服务端选择密码套件和密钥协商算法
时，他已准备好生成密钥，因为已经拥有客户端的共享密钥。所以它可以提前一次握手切就发送加密数据包。

So the server sends the ServerHello, its key share, the certificate (now encrypted, since it has a key!), and already the Finished message.<br>
所以服务端发送 ServerHello，共享密钥，证书（加密的，因为是一个密钥(key)!），和一个完成的消息。

The client receives all that, generates the keys using the key share, checks the certificate and Finished, and it's immediately ready to send the HTTP request, after only one round-trip. Which can be hundreds of milliseconds.<br>
客户端全部收到后，使用共享密钥生成密钥key，检查证书并完成，然后马上准备发送 HTTP 请求，只经过一次握手。耗时仅为几百毫秒。

## Resumption
One existing way to speed up TLS connections is called resumption. It's what happens when the client has connected to that server before, and uses what they remember from the last time to cut short the handshake.<br>
现有加速 TLS 连接的一种方式称为恢复（Resumption）。当客户端之前连接过服务端，就会使用上次保存的内容缩短握手时间。

### TLS 1.2 Resumption

![TLS-1.3.010](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.010.png){:width="100%"}

How this worked in TLS 1.2 is that servers would send the client either a Session ID or a Session Ticket. The former is just a reference number that the server can trace back to a session, while the latter is an encrypted serialized session which allows the server not to keep state.<br>
TLS 1.2 Resumption 机制是服务端向客户端发送会话 ID 或会话票据。会话 ID 是服务端可追溯到会话的参考号码，会话票据是一个加密的序列化会话，这允许服务器不保持状态。

The next time the client would connect, it would send the Session ID or Ticket in the ClientHello, and the server would go like "hey, I know you, we have agreed on a key already", skip the whole key shares dance, and jump straight to Finished, saving a round-trip.<br>
当下一次客户端发起连接时，会通过 ClientHello 发送会话 ID 或票据，而服务器会这样回复 "hey，我知道你，我们已商定了一个加密方式"，来跳过整个共享密钥阶段，直接跳到完成阶段，节省一个握手环节。

### TLS 1.3 0-RTT Resumption

So, we have a way to do 1-RTT connections in 1.2 if the client has connected before, which is very common. Then what does 1.3 gain us? When resumption is available, 1.3 allows us to do 0-RTT connections, again saving one round trip and ending up with no round trip at all.<br>
因此，如果客户端之前连接过，我们有一种机制在 1.2 中进行 1-RTT 连接，这很常见。那么 1.3 有哪些改进？当恢复可用时，1.3 可以执行 0-RTT 连接，再次节省一次握手环节，也就是不再有握手。

If you have connected to a 1.3 server before you can immediately start sending encrypted data, like an HTTP request, without any round-trip at all, making TLS essentially zero overhead.<br>
如果您连接过 1.3 服务器，则可立即开始发送加密数据（就像 HTTP 请求一样），不需要进行任何握手操作，使 TLS 在建立连接时零开销。

![TLS-1.3.012](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.012.png){:width="100%"}

When a 1.3 client connects to a 1.3 server they agree on a resumption key (or PSK, pre-shared key), and the server gives the client a Session Ticket that will help it remember it. The Ticket can be an encrypted copy of the PSK—to avoid state—or a reference number.<br>
当 1.3 客户端连接到 1.3 服务端时，他们在恢复密钥（或PSK，pre-shared key）上达成一致，服务端给客户端提供会话票据，来标记连接。该票可以是 PSK 的加密副本，以避暴露状态或引用的号码。

The next time the client connects, it sends the Session Ticket in the ClientHello and then immediately, without waiting for any round trip, sends the HTTP request encrypted with the PSK. The server figures out the PSK from the Session Ticket and uses that to decrypt the 0-RTT data.
The client also sends a key share, so that client and server can switch to a new fresh key for the actual HTTP response and the rest of the connection.<br>
下一次客户端连接时，它会在 ClientHello 中发送 Session Ticket，然后立即发送用 PSK 加密的 HTTP 请求，而不用等待任何往返。<br>
客户端还发送共享密钥，以便客户端和服务端可以切换一个新 Key 用于实际 HTTP 响应和连接的其余部分。

![TLS-1.3.013](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.013.png){:width="100%"}

0-RTT comes with a couple of caveats.<br>
0-RTT 的一些注意事项。

Since the PSK is not agreed upon with a fresh round of Diffie Hellman, it does not provide Forward Secrecy against a compromise of the Session Ticket key. That is, if in a year an attacker somehow obtains the Session Ticket key, it can decrypt the Session Ticket, obtain the PSK and decrypt the 0-RTT data the client sent (but not the rest of the connection).<br>
当 PSK 在新一轮的 DH 算法中没用达成一致时，它不会提供前向保密和会话票据。也就是说，如果攻击者在某一年以某种方式获得会话票据密钥，它可以解密会话票据，获得 PSK 并解密客户端发送的0-RTT数据（但不包括连接的其他内容）。

This is why it's important to rotate often and not persist Session Ticket keys (CloudFlare rotates these keys hourly).<br>
这就是为什么经常轮换而不使用 Session Ticket 的原因（CloudFlare每小时旋转一次这些密钥）。

TLS 1.2 has never provided any Forward Secrecy against a compromise of the Session Ticket key at all, so even with 0-RTT 1.3 is an improvement upon 1.2.<br>
TLS 1.2 从未提供任何前向保密的机制来防止会话票证密钥的泄露，所以使用 0-RTT 1.3，也是对 1.2 的改进。

![TLS-1.3.014](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.014.png){:width="100%"}

More problematic are replay attacks.<br>
更重要的问题是重连攻击。

Since with Session Tickets servers are stateless, they have no way to know if a packet of 0-RTT data was already sent before.<br>
当会话票据服务没有任何状态时，攻击者无法知道之前是否发送过 0-RTT 数据包。

Imagine that the 0-RTT data a client sent is not an HTTP GET ("hey, send me this page") but instead an HTTP POST executing a transaction like "hey, send Filippo 50\$". If I'm in the middle I can intercept that ClientHello+0-RTT packet, and then re-send it to the server 100 times. No need to know any key. I now have 5000$.<br>
Every time the server will see a Session Ticket, unwrap it to find the PSK, use the PSK to decrypt the 0-RTT data and find the HTTP POST inside, with no way to know something is fishy.<br>
想象一下，客户发送的 0-RTT 数据不是 HTTP GET（“嗨，给我发送这个页面”），而是一个 HTTP POST 执行一个事务，比如“嘿，发送Filippo 50$”。如果我是中间人，我可以拦截 ClientHello + 0-RTT 数据包，然后重新将它发送到服务器100次。 不需要知道任何钥匙。 我现在有5000美元。<br>
每当服务端收到一个会话票据，解开它获得 PSK，使用 PSK 来解密 0-RTT 数据并找到 HTTP POST，不会有任何可疑的迹象。

The solution is that servers must not execute operations that are not idempotent received in 0-RTT data. Instead in those cases they should force the client to perform a full 1-RTT handshake. That protects from replay since each ClientHello and ServerHello come with a Random value and connections have sequence numbers, so there's no way to replay recorded traffic verbatim.<br>
解决方案是，服务器不执行在 0-RTT 数据中未收到幂等的操作。相反，在这些情况下，他们应该强制客户端执行完整的 1-RTT 握手。由于每个 ClientHello 和 ServerHello 都带有一个随机值，并且连接具有序列号，所以无法逐字回放录制的流量，从而避免重连攻击。

Thankfully, most times the first request a client sends is not a state-changing transaction, but something idempotent like a GET.<br>
令人欣慰的是，大多数时候，客户端发送的第一个请求不是一个改变状态的事务，而是像 GET 一样幂等的东西。

## Changes

![TLS-1.3.016](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.016.png){:width="100%"}

![TLS-1.3.017](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.017.png){:width="100%"}

![TLS-1.3.018](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.018.png){:width="100%"}

TLS 1.3 is not only good for cutting a round-trip. It's also better, more robust crypto all around.<br>
TLS 1.3 不仅仅是减少了一次握手。它还有更好的改变，更强大的加密技术。

Most importantly, many things were removed. 1.3 marked a shift in the design approach: it used to be the case that the TLS committee would accept any proposal that made sense, and implementations like OpenSSL would add support for it. Think for example Heartbeats, the rarely used feature that cause Heartbleed.<br>

In 1.3, everything was scrutinized for being really necessary and secure, and scrapped otherwise. A lot of things are gone:

* the old static RSA handshake without Diffie Hellman, which doesn't offer Forward Secrecy
* the CBC MAC-then-Encrypt modes, which were responsible for Vaudenay, Lucky13, POODLE, LuckyMinus20... replaced by AEADs
* weak primitives like RC4, SHA1, MD5
* compression
* renegotiation
* custom FFDHE groups
* RSA PKCS#1v1.5
* explicit nonces

We'll go over these in more detail in future blog posts.<br>
Some of these were not necessarily broken by design, but they were dangerous, hard to implement correctly and easy to get wrong. The new excellent trend of TLS 1.3 and cryptography in general is to make mistakes less likely at the design stage, since humans are not perfect.

#### Anti-downgrade

![TLS-1.3.019](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.019.png){:width="100%"}

A new version of a protocol obviously can't dictate how older implementations behave and 1.3 can't improve the security of 1.2 systems. So how do you make sure that if tomorrow TLS 1.2 is completely broken, a client and server that both support 1.2 and 1.3 can't be tricked into using 1.2 by a Man in the Middle (MitM)?

A MitM could change the ClientHello to say "I want to talk at most TLS 1.2", and then use whichever attack it discovered to make the 1.2 connection succeed even if it tampered with a piece of the handshake.

1.3 has a clever solution to this: if a 1.3 server has to use 1.2 because it looks like the client doesn't support 1.3, it will "hide a message" in the Server Random value. A real 1.2 will completely ignore it, but a client that supports 1.3 would know to look for it, and would discover that it's being tricked into downgrading to 1.2.

The Server Random is signed with the certificate in 1.2, so it's impossible to fake even if pieces of 1.2 are broken. This is very important because it will allow us to keep supporting 1.2 in the future even if it's found to be weaker, unlike we had to do with SSLv3 and POODLE. With 1.3 we will know for sure that clients that can do any better are not being put at risk, allowing us to make sure the Internet is for Everyone.

![TLS-1.3.020](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.020.png){:width="100%"}

So this is TLS 1.3. Meant to be a solid, safe, robust, simple, essential foundation for Internet encryption for the years to come. And it's faster, so that no one will have performance reasons not to implement it.

TLS 1.3 is still a draft and it might change before being finalized, but at CloudFlare we are actively developing a 1.3 stack compatible with current experimental browsers, so everyone can get it today.

![TLS-1.3.023](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nikolilol/xPictures/master/TLS1.3/TLS-1.3.023.png){:width="100%"}

The TLS 1.3 spec is on GitHub, so anyone can contribute. Just while making the slides for this presentation I noticed I was having a hard time understanding a system because a diagram was missing some details, so I submitted a PR to fix it. How easy is that!?
